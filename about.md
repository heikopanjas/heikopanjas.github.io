Hey,

I am a freelance C/C++ developer with more than 25 years of experience in international projects in process and factory automation and transportation sectors.

I specialize in communication protocols, business logic design and database integration.

I bring experience in functional safety, security, reliability and maintainability to keep systems running smoothly.

In my spare time, I contribute to the independent podcast community. After spending over 10 years with [Ultraschall](https://ultraschall.fm){:target="_blank"}, an [open-source](https://github.com/ultraschall){:target="_blank"} software for professional podcast production, I'm now doing other things.

Gotta go...
