Hey,

I am a freelance C/C++ developer with more than 25 years of experience in international projects in the fields of transportation, mobility and process and factory automation.

I take care of communication protocol implementation, business logic design and database integration. Only backend and server, I don't do user interfaces or frontends.

And to make sure everything runs smoothly, I also know a thing or two about functional safety, reliability and maintainability.

In my spare time, I contribute to [Ultraschall](https://ultraschall.fm){:target="_blank"}, an [open-source](https://github.com/ultraschall){:target="_blank"} software for professional podcast production.

Gotta go...
